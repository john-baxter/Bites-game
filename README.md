# Bites-game

#### A game by Brigitte Ditt, Wolfgang Ditt, Anca Gavril & Filip Gavril
#### Software architecture & Technical leadership by Ana Andres
#### Code written by John Baxter

## Scope
This project aims to create a playable clone of the existing tabletop game ['Bites'](https://www.boardgametables.com/products/bites-board-game).

The programming language will be Python. This will serve as an introduction to a new language while working on a project that is fun and interesting.

## MVP
The basic game will be playable by at least two players (details about the interface TBD) using basic rules i.e.
  - no chocolate
  - no wine
  - imposed 'Overachiever' setup for anthill level assigning
